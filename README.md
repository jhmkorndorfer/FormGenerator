In view of shortcomings in form generators available on the market,
this software proposes a new model for this type of system. The model
intends to solve questions related to data typing and version control
of the forms. There are four modules, form's masks and fields
construction, data insertion, data validation and reports. The
graphical interface allows the user to build the form at all and also
choose or define new/old versions of the same form. New field types
can be defined and used on different forms. In addition, there is a
structure for data insertion that facilitates researches and reports.
